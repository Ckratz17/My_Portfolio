# My_Portfolio

## Project Status
ONGOING

## Description

Added a radial gradient background-image to the body.

Added a different gradient background-image to the header and footer. 

The links in the nav bar will take you to the section on the page. 

Added placeholder images for the work examples and will be updating them as my portfolio grows.

Hovering over the work examples will change the border color, the opacity of the image, and the color of the font.

Clicking the links in the footer will take you to the proper way-point of either calling, emailing, or visiting my repository.

Adjusted for reactivity by adding a flex display to the header,nav, list items, and the work examples.

Adjusted the paragraph margin when the screen changes by adding a media query.
